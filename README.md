# FastBitSet.js : a speed-optimized BitSet implementation


A BitSet  (also called Bitmap or bit vector) is an ideal data structure to implement a
set when values being stored are reasonably small integers. It can be orders of magnitude
faster than a generic set implementation. In particular, a BitSet has fast support for set
operations (union, difference, intersection).

The FastBitSet.js implementation optimizes for speed. It can be several times faster than competitive alternatives. It is also entirely
dynamic, and has functions to minimize the memory usage. It should be supported by most of the modern
browsers and JavaScript engines.  It is ideal for maintaining sets of integers when performance matters.


Note that the nearly equivalent [TypedFastBitSet](https://github.com/lemire/TypedFastBitSet.js) library should use less memory in practice and should be prefered is memory usage is a concern. For high-performance and low-memory usage, consider the even better [roaring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/roaring) library: it should surpass both FastBitSet and TypedFastBitSet for a wide range of tasks.

Usage
===

```javascript
const b = new FastBitSet();// initially empty
b.add(1);// add the value "1"
b.has(1); // check that the value is present! (will return true)
b.add(2);
console.log(""+b);// should display {1,2}
b.add(10);
b.array(); // would return [1,2,10]
let c = new FastBitSet([1,2,3,10]); // create bitset initialized with values 1,2,3,10
c.difference(b); // from c, remove elements that are in b (modifies c)
c.difference2(b) // from c, remove elements that are in b (modifies b)
c.change(b); // c will contain all elements that are in b or in c, but not both (elements that changed)
const su = c.union_size(b);// compute the size of the union (bitsets are unchanged)
c.union(b); // c will contain all elements that are in c and b
const out1 = c.new_union(b); // creates a new bitmap that contains everything in c and b
const out2 = c.new_intersection(b); // creates a new bitmap that contains everything that is in both c and b
const out3 = c.new_change(b); // creates a new bitmap that contains everything in b or in c, but not both
const s1 = c.intersection_size(b);// compute the size of the intersection (bitsets are unchanged)
const s2 = c.difference_size(b);// compute the size of the difference (bitsets are unchanged)
const s3 = c.change_size(b); // compute the number of elements that are in b but not c, or vice versa
c.intersects(b); // return true if c intersects with b
c.intersection(b); // c will only contain elements that are in both c and b
c = b.clone(); // create a (deep) copy of b and assign it to c.
c.equals(b); // checks whether c and b are equal
c.forEach(fnc); // execute fnc on each value stored in c
for (const x of c) fnc(x); // execute fnc on each value stored in c (allows early exit with break)
c.trim(); // reduce the memory usage of the bitmap if possible, the content remains the same
```

If you are using node.js, you need to import the module:

```javascript
var FastBitSet = require("fastbitset");
var b = new FastBitSet();// initially empty
b.add(1);// add the value "1"
```


Performance tip: in-place functions such as intersection, union and difference can be
much faster than functions generating a new bitmap (new_intersection, new_union
and new_difference) because they avoid creating a new object, a potentially
expensive process in JavaScript. For faster code, use as few FastBitSet objects as
you can.

API
===

## Constructor

- `new FastBitSet([iterable])` - Creates a new FastBitSet. If an iterable is provided, initializes the set with its values.

## Static Methods

- `FastBitSet.fromWords(words)` - Creates a FastBitSet from an array of 32-bit words.

## Instance Methods

### Size and Memory

- `size()` - Returns the number of values stored in the set.
- `trim()` - Reduces memory usage to a minimum.
- `resize(index)` - Ensures the bitset can store values up to the given index.

### Basic Operations

- `add(index)` - Adds the value (sets the bit at index to true).
- `remove(index)` - Removes the value (sets the bit at index to false).
- `has(index)` - Returns true if the value is in the set.
- `flip(index)` - Flips the bit at index (adds if not present, removes if present).
- `checkedAdd(index)` - Tries to add the value, returns 1 if added, 0 if already present.
- `clear()` - Removes all values and resets memory usage.
- `isEmpty()` - Returns true if no bits are set.

If you call `add`, `checkedAdd`, `flip` repeatedly, in a way that extends the
bitset, you may want to call `resize(maxvalue)`


### Iteration and Conversion

- `array()` - Returns an array with all set bit locations.
- `forEach(fnc)` - Executes a function on each value stored in the set.
- `toString()` - Returns a string representation of the set.
- `[Symbol.iterator]()` - Returns an iterator over the set values.

### Set Operations (In-place)

- `intersection(otherbitmap)` - Modifies this set to contain only elements present in both sets.
- `union(otherbitmap)` - Modifies this set to contain all elements from both sets.
- `difference(otherbitmap)` - Modifies this set to remove elements present in the other set (A = A - B).
- `difference2(otherbitmap)` - Modifies the other set to contain the difference (B = A - B).
- `change(otherbitmap)` - Modifies this set to contain elements that are in one set but not both (XOR).

### Set Operations (New Set)

- `new_intersection(otherbitmap)` - Returns a new set containing the intersection.
- `new_union(otherbitmap)` - Returns a new set containing the union.
- `new_difference(otherbitmap)` - Returns a new set containing the difference.
- `new_change(otherbitmap)` - Returns a new set containing the symmetric difference (XOR).

### Size Queries

- `intersection_size(otherbitmap)` - Returns the size of the intersection without modifying sets.
- `union_size(otherbitmap)` - Returns the size of the union without modifying sets.
- `difference_size(otherbitmap)` - Returns the size of the difference without modifying sets.
- `change_size(otherbitmap)` - Returns the number of elements that differ between the sets.

### Comparison and Utility

- `intersects(otherbitmap)` - Returns true if the sets have any common elements.
- `equals(otherbitmap)` - Checks if this set is equal to another.
- `clone()` - Creates a deep copy of the set.
